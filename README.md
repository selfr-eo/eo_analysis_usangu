# EO analysis of Usangu wetlands

Code and notebooks for eo analysis of the hydrology of the Usangu wetlands in Tanzania. Current repo functions include:

**SWOT:**
* Downloading SWOT pixel cloud data
* Processing SWOT pixel cloud data to 100 m raster format
* Creating weekly or monthly aggregates of pixel cloud rasters
* Creating occurance product from pixel cloud raster

**Sentinel-2:**
* Batch downloading S2 optical imagery in selected AOIs

**PALSAR-2:**
* Comparison of PALSAR2 backscatter in a flooded forest with rainfall runoff model output and nearest in situ river gauge.

Interesting questions/investigations:
* How do spatial patterns in SWOT flooded areas relate to methane emissions patterns as observed by Sentinel-5?
* Do large scale burn events in the dry season have an effect on Sentinel-5 emissions observations?
* Seasonal and interannual variability: Is the hydrology of Usangu changing? Visisble from SWOT? Other radar satellites? GRACE? 
* Are there any distict spatial patterns observable with EO?
